# Changelog

All notable changes to agent-stuff are documented here.

## Unreleased

* Removed the unused `goal.ts` extension.
* Synced `prompt-editor.ts` and `side-chat` source from their latest upstream versions.
* Retired `forget` to `optional-extensions/`; it is no longer loaded by the package.
* Removed the unused `pi-schedule-prompt` extension.
* Removed the unused `files.ts` extension.
* Recorded explicit exclusions for every currently absent Mitsuhiko extension and skill, and preserved the exclusion ledger when refreshing upstream pins.
* Added the `/discuss` planning-interviewer prompt command.
* Updated `pi-review` with upstream clean-code and fail-fast review guidelines.
* Added `no-bash-sleep.ts` extension to intercept `sleep` in bash tool calls: short sleeps (≤5 min) are allowed for backoff/debounce; long or variable-duration sleeps are blocked with a message directing to `/schedule-prompt`.
* Added a new `/forget` extension workflow that runs a compaction-shaped cleanup pass through Pi's normal compaction UI/persistence path without direct session-file surgery.
* Renamed the `lead-worker` extension vocabulary and commands to planner/builder: `/lead` → `/plan`, `/worker` → `/builder`, with planner/builder settings keys and runtime artifacts updated to match.
* Checked upstream/main and recorded the current pins in `UPSTREAMS.md`; no code sync was applied.
* Removed `pi-messenger` extension and `/pi-messenger-crew` skill.
* Removed `pi-subagents` extension.
* Re-added `pi-subagents` extension (synced to latest upstream `tintinweb/pi-subagents` v0.5.1).
* Removed `pi-subagents` extension again.
* Removed `session-stats` extension.
* Removed `damage-control` extension.
* Removed `lsp.ts` extension.
* Synced `pi-subagents/agent-runner.ts` selectively to upstream `tintinweb/pi-subagents@94f7f78` to bind subagent extensions and ensure `session_start` handlers initialize.
* Recorded the recent upstream inspection in `UPSTREAMS.md` and kept the codebase unchanged.
* Removed `pi-extensions/review.ts` and copied in upstream `earendil-works/pi-review` under `pi-extensions/pi-review/`, removing the local loop-fixing variant and restoring the standalone `/review` + `/end-review` workflow.
* Removed `answer.ts` extension.
* Added `plan-build` as a planner/builder mode controller with explicit `start` / `on` / `status` / `off` / `stop`, read-only planner mode, planner-model switching with restore on `off`, `/build` delegation to a persistent tmux-backed builder session, planner-session-scoped builders (different planner sessions no longer share a builder), startup output that shows the paired planner session, an internal session-scoped planner↔builder mailbox with direct `plan_build({ action: "message", ... })` messaging, `stop` semantics that also exit planner mode when the builder is explicitly stopped, layered settings via bundled/global/project `plan-build-settings.yaml` files, split builder `model`/`thinking` settings (with legacy `model: provider/id:thinking` shorthand still accepted), default planner settings that omit `bash` unless re-enabled in global/project overrides, and a default builder target of `openai/gpt-5.3-codex` with thinking `off`.
* Removed `pi-autoresearch` extension and `/autoresearch-create` skill.
* Added `pdf` skill for PDF processing (text/table extraction, merge/split/rotate, form filling, OCR, encryption, and PDF creation) with `uv run` inline script metadata.
* Added `prompt-editor.ts` extension for in-editor prompt mode selection with per-mode model and thinking persistence.
* Removed `go-to-bed.ts` extension (late-night safety guard during quiet hours).
* Removed `web-browser` skill scripts.
* Added CLI interface for session control.
* Added mode management UI to prompt editor (add, rename, delete, edit).
* Fixed review branch selector to omit current branch.
* Fixed prompt-editor mode persistence and detection logic.
* Fixed summarize skill to write unique temp markdown files.
* Removed `ghidra` skill and `nightowl` theme.
* Added `docs/` folder with OpenCode plan mode study and pi extension writing guide.
